The HRQOL dataset summarizes Healthy Days Measures from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey.

Healthy Days Measures: 
  Physical Health:
  “Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical
  illness and injury, how many days during the past 30 days was your
  physical health not good?”
  Mental Health:
  “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress,
  depression, and problems with emotions, how many days during the
  past 30 days was your mental health not good?"
